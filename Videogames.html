			alt = "APEX"
			width = "200" height =300/>Apex Legends
				<p> I like Apex the most because of mostly the game mechanics. Apex Legends is what's known
				as a hero battle royal. Which essentially boils down to you picking a character and fighting 
				other people in a last team standing battle. The game mechanics aren't he only thing i like though.
				The way the guns work in apex is also pretty great. The guns all feel smooth to use, although some 
				of them have quite a steep learning curve.</p></li>
				
			<li class="text"><img 
			src = "Images/Hades.png"
			class="floaty"
			alt = "HADES"
			width = "200" height =300/>Hades
				<p> Hades is in my top 5 because of the type of game it is not necessarily because of mechanics like Apex was.
			Hades is whats known as a dungeon crawler/rogue like. Rogue likes are games where you upgrade as you go 
			in Hades' case you get stronger by collecting things throughout the dungeons, which you can spend after you die.
			Hades is one of the only games I know that encourages dying.</p></li>

			<img 
			src = "Images/Minecraft.png"
			class="floaty"
			alt = "MINECRAFT"
			width = "200" height =300/>Minecraft
				<p> Come on do I really have to explain myself here Minecraft has been in the top 10 best selling games for years
			Minecraft was released in 2009 and still is one of the most popular games of all time. Which speaks for itsself.
			I've been playing Minecraft since it came out and still have yet to get bored of it or run out of things to do.</p></li>
			<li class="text"><img 
			src = "Images/FNF.jpg"
			class="floaty"
			alt = "FNF"
			width = "200" height =300/>Friday Night Funkin
				<p> Friday Night Funkin a.k.a FNF is known as a rythym game. I dont really know how to explain it but think guitar hero.
			FNF has so many mods, each of which having their own songs. There's not much base game content, however the game isnt fully released yet 
			so there is still much more to look foward too.</p></li>
			<li class="text">
			<img 
			src = "Images/Splitgate.jpg"
			class="floaty"
			alt = "SPLITGATE"
			width = "200" height =300/>SplitGate
				<p>SplitGate is a shooter game that came out not too long ago, so i dont have much to say about it because it's still in beta.
				The maps and guns run pretty smooth which is good for a game thats still in beta.</p></li>
